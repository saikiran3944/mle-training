# Machine Learning Engineering Coding Best Practices
# Model Evaluation and Validation
## Project: Median housing value prediction

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the Python libraries can be installed:

- `pip install {{package_name}}`

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `mle-training-/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```powershell
ipython notebook MLE-Training Housing.ipynb
```  
or
```powershell
jupyter notebook
```
This will open the code and project file.

### Data

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data.

The following techniques have been used:

- Linear regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

**Steps performed**
- We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
- Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
- Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
- All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean   squared error.
